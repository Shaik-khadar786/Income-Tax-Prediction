# Income Tax Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **income tax paid by an individual** based on structured financial data such as age, annual income, investments, and deductions.  
A **Linear Regression** model is trained and evaluated to understand the relationship between financial features and tax liability.

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, from data preparation to model evaluation and deployment-ready structure.
